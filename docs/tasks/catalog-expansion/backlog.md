# Backlog — grow the print catalog

Loop: [`catalog-expansion.md`](../../../.claude/loop-prompts/catalog-expansion.md). Done
list: [`done.md`](done.md). How to feed it: [the loop README](../../../.claude/loop-prompts/README.md).

Goal, per pass: the [ledger](../../constructions/ledger.md)'s migrated count up by one, or
the queue of screened candidates grown, each with a written GO or NO-GO.

## Open, in ROI order

1. **`nmEjCTzMbDg` still FAILs O1 and O2, and waits on youtube.** Causes found on
   2026-09-27 ([the FAILs note](../../research/ledger-oracle-fails-2026-09-27.md)). The
   youtube source's `R = Intersect(t, m, 2)` picks the other root in bikar. The patch,
   `Intersect(t, m, S)`, is proposed there and has not been made. Once youtube takes it:
   - regenerate the bikar fixture and goldens;
   - re-vendor the coaster and look at it (it is near-solid now: **do not print it**);
   - re-run O1 and O2.

   What O1 still cannot compare (parabolas, hyperbolas, arcs, the `*_host` circles) is
   youtube's to add. Also youtube's: `naqsh_score.py` treats `ggb_score.py`'s FAIL exit
   (2) as a crash. That patch is in the same note.
2. **The queue is empty.** Fewer than three screened GO candidates, and every construction so
   far comes from one creator (Sarah Brewer). Crawl out from youtube's discovery wiki for new
   creators, fold counts and tilings; screen each and write GO or NO-GO with the date.
3. **frame block (P5.3)** — only if a public GeoGebra file needs one; nothing does yet. Moved
   from the coaster-pipeline backlog on 2026-09-25, where it sat by mistake (board #7).

## Handed to the video loop

GO candidates not yet reconstructed go to the youtube repo's ladder, not here. Name the id
in this list when you hand it on, and move it to item 2's shape when it comes back done.
